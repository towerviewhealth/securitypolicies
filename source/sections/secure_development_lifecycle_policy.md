# Secure Development Lifecycle Policy

All systems and software development work done at TowerView Health adheres to industry best practices with regard to a Systems (Software) Development Life Cycle. These industry standard development phases are defined by ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207. The minimum required phases and the tasks and considerations within these Systems development phases are outlined below. All of the following sub-tasks and considerations, as listed in the below respective standard development phases, are mandatory if the system or software development deals with Level 1 data in any way. Otherwise, the sub-tasks and considerations are recommended steps within the required standard development phases.

## System Initiation:

* A need or opportunity is defined.
* Concept proposal is made.
* An initial feasibility study is conducted.
* A project charter (if necessary) is formulated.

## System Requirements Analysis:

* Analyze user needs and develop user requirements.
* Create a detailed Functional Requirements Document.
Break down the system, process, or problem into discrete units or modules and utilize diagrams and other visual tools in order * to analyze the situation or need.
* Any security requirements must be defined.

## System Design

* This phase transforms the requirements into a Design Document.
* The functions and operations of the system or software being designed are described in detail.
* A risk analysis should be done between the System Requirements and System Design phases.
* A final design review should be done to ensure the design addresses practicality, efficiency, cost, flexibility, and security.

## System Construction (Procurement):

* This phase entails the transformation of the detailed design documents into a finished product or solution.
* Manual and automated testing at a unit or module level is done throughout this phase by the system or software developers. Security considerations are taken into account during testing.
* A third-party product may be utilized as a system or software solution if it best fits the user requirements and is more practical from a budgetary and/or resource perspective. However, all of the next phases should be followed regardless of whether the solution was developed in-house or purchased.

## System Testing and Acceptance:

* This phase should validate or confirm that the developed system or software meets all functional requirements as captured * during the System Requirements Analysis phase.
* Representatives separate from the development group should conduct internal Quality Assurance (QA) testing.
* Representative(s) from the user group should conduct user acceptance testing.
* Documentation during testing should detail and match testing criteria to specific requirements.
* While unit and module testing should be done throughout the entire SDLC, this phase entails holistic testing of the finished * product and the final acceptance testing by the user(s).
* Final security assessment testing is now conducted.
* Any problems identified during the previous phases must be resolved or remediated before implementation.

## System Implementation:

* The finished, tested, and user-accepted system or software is moved from the testing environment to production.
* All tools, code, or access mechanisms used for development or testing of the system or software must be removed from the software that is being moved into a production environment.
* Any necessary user training should be done prior to or during this phase.

## System Maintenance

* This phase is the ongoing life of the system or software. Unlike the other phases, this phase only ends when the system or software is decommissioned.
* A customer/user support structure and any other necessary operational support processes should be in place.
* Any planned changes to the system or software should be scheduled, communicated, and documented.
* Continuous security penetration testing is conducted on the system or software throughout its life cycle on a quarterly basis.
* Mandatory security testing is conducted when any major configuration or architecture change is made.
